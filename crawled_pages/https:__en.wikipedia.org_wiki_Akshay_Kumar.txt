Referred to in the media as \"Khiladi Kumar\", [ 3 ] [ 4 ] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards , including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards . He received the Padma Shri , India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi . The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series , in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005). While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal , Housefull 4 , Good Newwz , and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi . All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023). [ 12 ] In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor . [ a ] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi , which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League . The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. [ 16 ] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]    Early life and background  Kumar was born in Old Delhi in Delhi, India, [ 20 ] [ 1 ] [ b ] to Hari Om Bhatia (later Brijmohan Bhatia) [ 1 ] and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi  Hindu family. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] His father was an army officer. [ 23 ] From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF . [ 20 ] Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada , a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay. [ 21 ] He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga , [ 24 ] simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing . [ 21 ] [ 25 ] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia. [ 26 ] When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor. [ 27 ] After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, [ 28 ] he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. [ 29 ] After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel as a chef [ 30 ] and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ] During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films. [ 33 ] Kumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name 'Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia', in a bit role as a Karate instructor. Kumar further stated that he changed his name to Akshay Hari Om Bhatia and chose his stage name as Akshay Kumar, after Kumar Gaurav 's character Akshay in the film. [ 34 ] One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]  Film career   Main article: Akshay Kumar filmography  1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films  Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer , which received poor reviews. [ 38 ] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan -directed suspense thriller, Khiladi , widely considered his breakthrough role . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] A review in The Indian Express called the film \"an engrossing thriller\" and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being \"perfectly at ease\". [ 41 ] His next release was the Raj Sippy -directed detective film Mr. Bond , based on James Bond . [ 42 ] His last release of 1992 was Deedar . It failed to perform well at the box office. [ 43 ] In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay -directed bilingual film Ashaant alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave . Almost all of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi , Kayda Kanoon and Sainik did not perform well commercially. [ 44 ] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films. [ 45 ] He played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan's Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Rajiv Rai 's Mohra , both among the highest-grossing films of the year. [ 46 ] Further success came later that year when he starred in Yash Chopra -produced romance Yeh Dillagi , opposite Kajol . One of the year's biggest mainstream successes, both the film and his performance were received well by critics, with The Indian Express describing him as \"always dependable\" and singling out his performance. [ 47 ] His work in the film earned him his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards [ 48 ] and the Screen Awards . [ 44 ] During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low-budget action film Elaan . All these achievements established Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year, according to Box Office India . [ 49 ] Kumar proved to have success with what later became known as the Khiladi series . He starred in the fourth and fifth action thriller films with Khiladi in the title: Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995) and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), both directed by Umesh Mehra and released to commercial success. He played a dual role in the former. [ 50 ]  Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi co-starred Rekha and Raveena Tandon . [ 51 ] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. [ 52 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote in a year-end review, \"It was Akshay Kumar in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal , wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker , and walked away with the film.\" [ 53 ] Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor , for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ 54 ] In the same year, he starred opposite Juhi Chawla in David Dhawan -directed comedy Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi , fifth instalment of the Khiladi series. Unlike his previous films of the series, it failed commercially. [ 55 ] Considerable success, however, came with another dual role in the romantic action film Aflatoon . Khalid Mohamed of Filmfare , while critical of the film, approved of Kumar's effort: \"Akshay Kumar comes to life. Given something even slightly different to do, he does rise to the occasion.\" [ 56 ] His following releases failed in commercial terms and this caused a setback to his film career. [ 57 ] In 1999, Kumar played opposite Twinkle Khanna in International Khiladi . The film did not do well at the box office. [ 58 ] He received critical acclaim for his roles in the films Sangharsh and Jaanwar . While the former did not make a profit at the box office, the latter turned out to be a commercial success and marked his comeback. [ 59 ] [ 58 ]  2000–2006: Hera Pheri and expansion to comedy films  In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan -directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and Suneil Shetty . The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking , [ 60 ] became a commercial success [ 61 ] and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career. [ 62 ]  Hindustan Times noted the film's \"intense portrayal of the surreality of the human condition\". [ 63 ] He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan -directed romantic drama Dhadkan later that same year. The film performed moderately at the box office [ 61 ] but Kumar was praised for his acting. [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Rediff.com ' s review stated that he had proved that he is \"director's actor\" and that \"he has worked hard on his role is apparent.\" [ 66 ] That same year, he performed some of his most dangerous stunts in Neeraj Vora-directed action thriller Khiladi 420 , where he climbed a running plane, stood on top of the plane flying a thousand feet in the air, and jumped from the plane onto a hot air balloon. In a later scene, he is also seen being chased by a car, dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and climbing walls. [ 67 ] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. [ 68 ] Sukanya Verma wrote \"Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand. [...] Akshay is ridiculously over the top and irritating to the core. However, he manages a decent performance as the sober and suave Anand.\" [ 69 ] Padmaraj Nair of Screen , however, believed it was \"the best performance of his career\". [ 70 ] His first release in 2001 was Suneel Darshan -directed drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love . Kumar was praised for his performance in the film. [ 71 ] Next, he played a negative role in the Abbas Mustan-directed film Ajnabee . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] While reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Sarita Tanwar termed Kumar the \"surprise package\" of the film. She added that he was \"in total control as the bad guy.\" [ 74 ] The film won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Villain and IIFA award 2002 for Performance in a Negative Role. [ 22 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]  Kumar on the sets of Heyy Babyy in Sydney , 2007  His first release in 2002 was Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya . He played the role as a blind man in Vipul Amrutlal Shah and Shaarang Dev Pandit-directed heist film  Aankhen , co-starring Amitabh Bachchan , Arjun Rampal , Aditya Pancholi , Sushmita Sen and Paresh Rawal. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Next, he starred in the Vikram Bhatt -directed comedy Awara Paagal Deewana . Rediff.com's review of the film mentioned that his sincerity and intensity seen in Hera Pheri , Ek Rishtaa – The Bond of Love and Aankhen \"seems missing\". [ 80 ] His last film of the year was Rajkumar Kohli -directed supernatural horror film  Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani alongside Manisha Koirala , Sunil Shetty , Sunny Deol , Aftab Shivdasani , Arshad Warsi , Aditya Pancholi and Armaan Kohli . The film was a remake of Kohli's former film Naagin and received mostly negative reviews from critics. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Taran Adarsh wrote \"only Munish[Armaan] Kohli and Akshay Kumar leave an impact.\" [ 83 ] In 2003, he starred in Suneel Darshan's action film Talaash: The Hunt Begins... opposite Kareena Kapoor . While reviewing the film, Taran Adarsh wrote \"Akshay Kumar is plain mediocre. The role hardly offers him scope to try out anything different.\" [ 84 ] Next, he starred in Raj Kanwar -directed romantic drama Andaaz alongside Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra . The film received mixed reviews from critics, [ 85 ] [ 86 ] but turned out to be a commercial success at the box office and the first universal hit of 2003. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In 2004 Kumar starred in Rajkumar Santoshi 's action drama thriller Khakee alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn and Aishwarya Rai . Kumar played the role of Inspector Shekhar Verma, a corrupt, morally bankrupt cop who changes himself during a mission to transfer an accused Pakistani spy Dr. Iqbal Ansari (played by Atul Kulkarni ) from a remote town in Maharashtra to Mumbai.

He played the role of Sunny, Sameer (played by Khan)'s roommate who pursuits Rani (played by Chopra)-Sameer's love interest. The film received positive reviews. [ 96 ] Taran Adarsh praised Kumar and wrote \"Akshay Kumar is a revelation [...] he surpasses his previous work. His timing is fantastic and the conviction with which he carries off the evil streak in his personality is bound to be talked-about in days to come.\" [ 97 ] His performance in the film earned him his third nomination for supporting actor at the Filmfare Awards as well as a nomination for best comic role . [ 98 ] His other films included Abbas-Mustan directed Aitraaz and S M Iqbal's Meri Biwi Ka Jawaab Nahin . In the former, Kumar played against type as a worker wrongly accused of sexual harassment by his female boss played by Chopra. According to the directors, Aitraaz was inspired by National Basketball Association player Kobe Bryant (who was accused of rape by a fan); [ 99 ] and the film's development began when they read about his sexual-assault case in the newspapers. [ 100 ] Talking about the character Kumar said that it is realistic and could be described as a \"new-age metrosexual \" man. He added that Aitraaz was the boldest film he had done. [ 101 ] In the latter, he starred opposite Sridevi . The film was shot in 1994 but was released in 2004 after a delay of 10 years. The next year Kumar starred in Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama  musical film  Bewafaa (2005) opposite Kareena Kapoor. He played the role of Raja, an aspiring musician who pursues his love interest Anjali (played by Kareena Kapoor) even after she is married to Aditya Sahai (played by Anil Kapoor ). The film received mixed reviews from film critic but Kumar was praised for his acting. Anupama Chopra of India Today wrote that \"Kareena Kapoor and Kumar stand out.\" Taran Adarsh wrote \"Akshay Kumar does well in a role that fits him like a glove.\" [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Later that year he acted in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama Waqt: The Race Against Time alongside Amitabh Bachchan, another Priyadarshan-directed comedy Garam Masala alongside John Abraham. Waqt: The Race Against Time was a family drama film. The film and Kumar's acting received mixed reviews. [ 104 ] Vishal D'Souza wrote \"Akshay shoulders an author-backed role, carrying more of the film's emotional baggage though he is distinctly uncomfortable in the soppy-weepy scenes.\" [ 105 ] The films succeeded at the box office [ 106 ] [ 107 ] and his performance in the latter earned him his second Filmfare Award, for Best Comedian . [ 22 ] His other films included Vikram Bhatt-directed action comedy romance film Deewane Huye Paagal and Suneel Darshan directed romantic drama Dosti: Friends Forever .

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

Referred to in the media as \"Khiladi Kumar\", [ 3 ] [ 4 ] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards , including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards . He received the Padma Shri , India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi . The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series , in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005). While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal , Housefull 4 , Good Newwz , and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi . All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023). [ 12 ] In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor . [ a ] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi , which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League . The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. [ 16 ] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]    Early life and background  Kumar was born in Old Delhi in Delhi, India, [ 20 ] [ 1 ] [ b ] to Hari Om Bhatia (later Brijmohan Bhatia) [ 1 ] and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi  Hindu family. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] His father was an army officer. [ 23 ] From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF . [ 20 ] Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada , a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay. [ 21 ] He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga , [ 24 ] simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing . [ 21 ] [ 25 ] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia. [ 26 ] When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor. [ 27 ] After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, [ 28 ] he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. [ 29 ] After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel as a chef [ 30 ] and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ] During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films. [ 33 ] Kumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name 'Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia', in a bit role as a Karate instructor. Kumar further stated that he changed his name to Akshay Hari Om Bhatia and chose his stage name as Akshay Kumar, after Kumar Gaurav 's character Akshay in the film. [ 34 ] One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]  Film career   Main article: Akshay Kumar filmography  1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films  Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer , which received poor reviews. [ 38 ] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan -directed suspense thriller, Khiladi , widely considered his breakthrough role . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] A review in The Indian Express called the film \"an engrossing thriller\" and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being \"perfectly at ease\". [ 41 ] His next release was the Raj Sippy -directed detective film Mr. Bond , based on James Bond . [ 42 ] His last release of 1992 was Deedar . It failed to perform well at the box office. [ 43 ] In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay -directed bilingual film Ashaant alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave . Almost all of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi , Kayda Kanoon and Sainik did not perform well commercially. [ 44 ] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films. [ 45 ] He played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan's Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Rajiv Rai 's Mohra , both among the highest-grossing films of the year. [ 46 ] Further success came later that year when he starred in Yash Chopra -produced romance Yeh Dillagi , opposite Kajol . One of the year's biggest mainstream successes, both the film and his performance were received well by critics, with The Indian Express describing him as \"always dependable\" and singling out his performance. [ 47 ] His work in the film earned him his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards [ 48 ] and the Screen Awards . [ 44 ] During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low-budget action film Elaan . All these achievements established Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year, according to Box Office India . [ 49 ] Kumar proved to have success with what later became known as the Khiladi series . He starred in the fourth and fifth action thriller films with Khiladi in the title: Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995) and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), both directed by Umesh Mehra and released to commercial success. He played a dual role in the former. [ 50 ]  Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi co-starred Rekha and Raveena Tandon . [ 51 ] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. [ 52 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote in a year-end review, \"It was Akshay Kumar in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal , wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker , and walked away with the film.\" [ 53 ] Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor , for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ 54 ] In the same year, he starred opposite Juhi Chawla in David Dhawan -directed comedy Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi , fifth instalment of the Khiladi series. Unlike his previous films of the series, it failed commercially. [ 55 ] Considerable success, however, came with another dual role in the romantic action film Aflatoon . Khalid Mohamed of Filmfare , while critical of the film, approved of Kumar's effort: \"Akshay Kumar comes to life. Given something even slightly different to do, he does rise to the occasion.\" [ 56 ] His following releases failed in commercial terms and this caused a setback to his film career. [ 57 ] In 1999, Kumar played opposite Twinkle Khanna in International Khiladi . The film did not do well at the box office. [ 58 ] He received critical acclaim for his roles in the films Sangharsh and Jaanwar . While the former did not make a profit at the box office, the latter turned out to be a commercial success and marked his comeback. [ 59 ] [ 58 ]  2000–2006: Hera Pheri and expansion to comedy films  In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan -directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and Suneil Shetty . The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking , [ 60 ] became a commercial success [ 61 ] and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career. [ 62 ]  Hindustan Times noted the film's \"intense portrayal of the surreality of the human condition\". [ 63 ] He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan -directed romantic drama Dhadkan later that same year. The film performed moderately at the box office [ 61 ] but Kumar was praised for his acting. [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Rediff.com ' s review stated that he had proved that he is \"director's actor\" and that \"he has worked hard on his role is apparent.\" [ 66 ] That same year, he performed some of his most dangerous stunts in Neeraj Vora-directed action thriller Khiladi 420 , where he climbed a running plane, stood on top of the plane flying a thousand feet in the air, and jumped from the plane onto a hot air balloon. In a later scene, he is also seen being chased by a car, dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and climbing walls. [ 67 ] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. [ 68 ] Sukanya Verma wrote \"Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand. [...] Akshay is ridiculously over the top and irritating to the core. However, he manages a decent performance as the sober and suave Anand.\" [ 69 ] Padmaraj Nair of Screen , however, believed it was \"the best performance of his career\". [ 70 ] His first release in 2001 was Suneel Darshan -directed drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love . Kumar was praised for his performance in the film. [ 71 ] Next, he played a negative role in the Abbas Mustan-directed film Ajnabee . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] While reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Sarita Tanwar termed Kumar the \"surprise package\" of the film. She added that he was \"in total control as the bad guy.\" [ 74 ] The film won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Villain and IIFA award 2002 for Performance in a Negative Role. [ 22 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]  Kumar on the sets of Heyy Babyy in Sydney , 2007  His first release in 2002 was Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya . He played the role as a blind man in Vipul Amrutlal Shah and Shaarang Dev Pandit-directed heist film  Aankhen , co-starring Amitabh Bachchan , Arjun Rampal , Aditya Pancholi , Sushmita Sen and Paresh Rawal. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Next, he starred in the Vikram Bhatt -directed comedy Awara Paagal Deewana . Rediff.com's review of the film mentioned that his sincerity and intensity seen in Hera Pheri , Ek Rishtaa – The Bond of Love and Aankhen \"seems missing\". [ 80 ] His last film of the year was Rajkumar Kohli -directed supernatural horror film  Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani alongside Manisha Koirala , Sunil Shetty , Sunny Deol , Aftab Shivdasani , Arshad Warsi , Aditya Pancholi and Armaan Kohli . The film was a remake of Kohli's former film Naagin and received mostly negative reviews from critics. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Taran Adarsh wrote \"only Munish[Armaan] Kohli and Akshay Kumar leave an impact.\" [ 83 ] In 2003, he starred in Suneel Darshan's action film Talaash: The Hunt Begins... opposite Kareena Kapoor . While reviewing the film, Taran Adarsh wrote \"Akshay Kumar is plain mediocre. The role hardly offers him scope to try out anything different.\" [ 84 ] Next, he starred in Raj Kanwar -directed romantic drama Andaaz alongside Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra . The film received mixed reviews from critics, [ 85 ] [ 86 ] but turned out to be a commercial success at the box office and the first universal hit of 2003. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In 2004 Kumar starred in Rajkumar Santoshi 's action drama thriller Khakee alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn and Aishwarya Rai . Kumar played the role of Inspector Shekhar Verma, a corrupt, morally bankrupt cop who changes himself during a mission to transfer an accused Pakistani spy Dr. Iqbal Ansari (played by Atul Kulkarni ) from a remote town in Maharashtra to Mumbai. The film and Kumar's acting were positively reviewed by critics. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award for his role in the film. [ 92 ] His other releases included Dileep Shukla's crime film Police Force: An Inside Story . He starred alongside Raveena Tandon, Amrish Puri and Raj Babbar . The film's production was delayed following the break-up of the lead actors Tandon and Kumar. [ 93 ] Upon release it received negative reviews from critics. [ 94 ] Next, Kumar played Hari Om Patnaik, an IPS officer in Madhur Bhandarkar -directed Aan: Men at Work . [ 95 ] He starred in David Dhawan-directed romantic comedy Mujhse Shaadi Karogi alongside Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra. He played the role of Sunny, Sameer (played by Khan)'s roommate who pursuits Rani (played by Chopra)-Sameer's love interest. The film received positive reviews. [ 96 ] Taran Adarsh praised Kumar and wrote \"Akshay Kumar is a revelation [...] he surpasses his previous work. His timing is fantastic and the conviction with which he carries off the evil streak in his personality is bound to be talked-about in days to come.\" [ 97 ] His performance in the film earned him his third nomination for supporting actor at the Filmfare Awards as well as a nomination for best comic role . [ 98 ] His other films included Abbas-Mustan directed Aitraaz and S M Iqbal's Meri Biwi Ka Jawaab Nahin . In the former, Kumar played against type as a worker wrongly accused of sexual harassment by his female boss played by Chopra. According to the directors, Aitraaz was inspired by National Basketball Association player Kobe Bryant (who was accused of rape by a fan); [ 99 ] and the film's development began when they read about his sexual-assault case in the newspapers. [ 100 ] Talking about the character Kumar said that it is realistic and could be described as a \"new-age metrosexual \" man. He added that Aitraaz was the boldest film he had done. [ 101 ] In the latter, he starred opposite Sridevi . The film was shot in 1994 but was released in 2004 after a delay of 10 years. The next year Kumar starred in Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama  musical film  Bewafaa (2005) opposite Kareena Kapoor.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

Referred to in the media as \"Khiladi Kumar\", [ 3 ] [ 4 ] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards , including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards . He received the Padma Shri , India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi . The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series , in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005). While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal , Housefull 4 , Good Newwz , and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi . All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023). [ 12 ] In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor . [ a ] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi , which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League . The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. [ 16 ] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]    Early life and background  Kumar was born in Old Delhi in Delhi, India, [ 20 ] [ 1 ] [ b ] to Hari Om Bhatia (later Brijmohan Bhatia) [ 1 ] and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi  Hindu family. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] His father was an army officer. [ 23 ] From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF . [ 20 ] Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada , a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay. [ 21 ] He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga , [ 24 ] simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing . [ 21 ] [ 25 ] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia. [ 26 ] When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor. [ 27 ] After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, [ 28 ] he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. [ 29 ] After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel as a chef [ 30 ] and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ] During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films. [ 33 ] Kumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name 'Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia', in a bit role as a Karate instructor. Kumar further stated that he changed his name to Akshay Hari Om Bhatia and chose his stage name as Akshay Kumar, after Kumar Gaurav 's character Akshay in the film. [ 34 ] One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]  Film career   Main article: Akshay Kumar filmography  1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films  Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer , which received poor reviews. [ 38 ] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan -directed suspense thriller, Khiladi , widely considered his breakthrough role . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] A review in The Indian Express called the film \"an engrossing thriller\" and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being \"perfectly at ease\". [ 41 ] His next release was the Raj Sippy -directed detective film Mr. Bond , based on James Bond . [ 42 ] His last release of 1992 was Deedar . It failed to perform well at the box office. [ 43 ] In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay -directed bilingual film Ashaant alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave . Almost all of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi , Kayda Kanoon and Sainik did not perform well commercially. [ 44 ] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films. [ 45 ] He played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan's Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Rajiv Rai 's Mohra , both among the highest-grossing films of the year. [ 46 ] Further success came later that year when he starred in Yash Chopra -produced romance Yeh Dillagi , opposite Kajol . One of the year's biggest mainstream successes, both the film and his performance were received well by critics, with The Indian Express describing him as \"always dependable\" and singling out his performance. [ 47 ] His work in the film earned him his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards [ 48 ] and the Screen Awards . [ 44 ] During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low-budget action film Elaan . All these achievements established Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year, according to Box Office India . [ 49 ] Kumar proved to have success with what later became known as the Khiladi series . He starred in the fourth and fifth action thriller films with Khiladi in the title: Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995) and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), both directed by Umesh Mehra and released to commercial success. He played a dual role in the former. [ 50 ]  Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi co-starred Rekha and Raveena Tandon . [ 51 ] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. [ 52 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote in a year-end review, \"It was Akshay Kumar in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal , wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker , and walked away with the film.\" [ 53 ] Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor , for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor .

Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ] During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films.

[ 51 ] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. [ 52 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote in a year-end review, \"It was Akshay Kumar in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal , wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker , and walked away with the film.\" [ 53 ] Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor , for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor .

[ 67 ] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. [ 68 ] Sukanya Verma wrote \"Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008).

[ 21 ] He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga , [ 24 ] simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing . [ 21 ] [ 25 ] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia.

Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ] During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films. [ 33 ] Kumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name 'Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia', in a bit role as a Karate instructor.

[ 51 ] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. [ 52 ] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote in a year-end review, \"It was Akshay Kumar in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal , wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker , and walked away with the film.\" [ 53 ] Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor , for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor .

[ 67 ] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. [ 68 ] Sukanya Verma wrote \"Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

Referred to in the media as \"Khiladi Kumar\", [ 3 ] [ 4 ] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards , including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards . He received the Padma Shri , India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi . The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series , in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

Referred to in the media as \"Khiladi Kumar\", [ 3 ] [ 4 ] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards , including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards . He received the Padma Shri , India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\npronounced\n[əkˈʂəj  kʊˈmɑːɾ]\n\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nKumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi . The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series , in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).\nWhile his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal , Housefull 4 , Good Newwz , and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi . All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023). [ 12 ]\n[\n]\nIn addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor . [ a ] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi , which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League . The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. [ 16 ] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nEarly life and background\nEarly life and background\nKumar was born in Old Delhi in Delhi, India, [ 20 ] [ 1 ] [ b ] to Hari Om Bhatia (later Brijmohan Bhatia) [ 1 ] and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi  Hindu family. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] His father was an army officer. [ 23 ] From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF . [ 20 ] Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada , a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay. [ 21 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nHe received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga , [ 24 ] simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing . [ 21 ] [ 25 ] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia. [ 26 ] When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor. [ 27 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nAfter having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, [ 28 ] he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. [ 29 ] After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel as a chef [ 30 ] and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts. [ 20 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nDuring this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He also worked as a background dancer in various films. [ 33 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nKumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name 'Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia', in a bit role as a Karate instructor. Kumar further stated that he changed his name to Akshay Hari Om Bhatia and chose his stage name as Akshay Kumar, after Kumar Gaurav 's character Akshay in the film. [ 34 ]\n[\n]\nOne morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nFilm career\nFilm career\nMain article: Akshay Kumar filmography\n1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films\n1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films\n\nKumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer , which received poor reviews. [ 38 ] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan -directed suspense thriller, Khiladi , widely considered his breakthrough role . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] A review in The Indian Express called the film \"an engrossing thriller\" and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being \"perfectly at ease\". [ 41 ] His next release was the Raj Sippy -directed detective film Mr. Bond , based on James Bond . [ 42 ] His last release of 1992 was Deedar . It failed to perform well at the box office. [ 43 ]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nIn 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay -directed bilingual film Ashaant alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave . Almost all of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi , Kayda Kanoon and Sainik did not perform well commercially. [ 44 ] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.  ^  \"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.

At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister. MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor's help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement.\n, retrieved 29 May 2020\n29 May\n\n^\n\"Akshay Kumar renounces Canadian citizenship, becomes Indian national again\" . 15 August 2023.
